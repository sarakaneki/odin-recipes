    <p class="description">I grew up eating Thai food that my mom made me, and these are some of my favorites. They are all very nostalgic dishes, and I've found that Pailin at Hot Thai Kitchen has easy-to-follow and authentic recipes that anyone can try out. I've included two savory recipes and one dessert. I hope that you all will try at least one of them - there is a a reason Thai food is so popular! And it's not all Pad Thai (I barely had it when I was younger).</p>
