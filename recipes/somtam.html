Som tum is primarily made with green, unripe papaya as its main ingredient. Som tum begins with thinly shredded green papaya, which is crisp and slightly bitter. This papaya is combined with a mixture of other ingredients to create a salad that is sweet, spicy, sour, savory, crunchy, fresh and full with umami:.
        This is a balanced dish that's not only visually appealing but also a symphony of flavors. Som tum is often served as a side dish or even as a main course, making it a popular choice among food enthusiasts worldwide.

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Drain the soaked papaya well and place in a bowl lined with 2 layers of paper towel to absorb excess water. You want to have as little water on the papaya as possible so as to not dilute the dressing.
        </li>
        <li>In a large mortar and pestle, pound garlic and chilies until there are no more big chunks (pieces of chili skin are fine).
        </li>
        <li>Add palm sugar and mash with the pestle until it turns into a wet paste and all the chunks are dissolved.
        </li>
        <li>Add long beans and pound just until they're broken.
        </li>
        <li>Add dried shrimp and peanuts and pound to break the peanuts up slightly.
        </li>
        <li>Add fish sauce, tamarind juice, and lime juice, adding the squeezed lime skin into the mortar as well for extra lime fragrance. Stir with a large spoon to mix and dissolve the sugar.
        </li>
        <li>Add shredded papaya and tomatoes, and mix using the pound-and-flip method as shown in the video @8:40. Once everything looks well mixed and the tomatoes are just slightly crushed, it's done!
        </li>
        <li>Plate and sprinkle with the remaining peanuts</li>
    </ol>
