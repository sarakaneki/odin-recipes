    <p>Tom Kha Gai is a fragrant Thai coconut soup featuring a harmonious blend of flavors. This soup is known for its creamy coconut milk base, which imparts a rich and slightly sweet taste. It's typically infused with lemongrass, galangal (a cousin of ginger), and kaffir lime leaves, which give it a unique and refreshing citrusy aroma.
        
        Tom Kha Gai is mildly spicy, thanks to the addition of Thai bird's eye chilies, but the heat can be adjusted to your preference. A touch of fish sauce and lime juice provides a savory and tangy balance to the soup. It's often garnished with fresh cilantro, adding a burst of herbal freshness to each spoonful.
